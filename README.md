# Flight-Analysis-Using-Python

# Project Overview
This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a comprehensive dataset of airline flight prices and schedules. The goal is to identify patterns in ticket pricing, travel duration, and booking trends across various Indian airlines and cities.

# Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to identify the key features that influence the price of flight tickets. Specifically, the project aims to:

- Analyze Price Trends: Understand how ticket prices vary across different airlines and cabin classes (Economy vs. Business).

- Timing Impact: Determine how the time of departure and arrival affects the cost of travel.

- Booking Lead Time: Investigate the relationship between the number of days left for departure and the ticket price.

- Duration & Stops: Evaluate how the total duration of the flight and the number of stops impact the final fare.

 # Key Insights
- Pricing Skewness: The average flight price is approximately ₹20,889, but the median is much lower at ₹7,425. This indicates a significant price gap between Economy and                          Business class tickets.

- Booking Lead Time: The days_left variable shows a mean of 26 days. Prices tend to fluctuate significantly based on how close the booking is to the departure date (ranging                                 from 1 to 49 days).

- Flight Duration: Travel times vary drastically, from a short 0.83 hours to a lengthy 49.83 hours, likely due to layovers (stops).

- Clean Data: The dataset is highly reliable for analysis with zero null values across all columns.

- Market Coverage: The data includes a balanced mix of low-cost carriers (Indigo, AirAsia, SpiceJet) and full-service airlines (Vistara, Air India).

# Conclusion
The analysis reveals that flight pricing is a highly dynamic variable influenced heavily by the class of travel and the booking window (days left). Preliminary findings suggest a significant price gap between Economy and Business classes, and a noticeable increase in ticket costs as the departure date approaches. By understanding these patterns, travelers can optimize their booking times, and airlines can better strategize their dynamic pricing models.
